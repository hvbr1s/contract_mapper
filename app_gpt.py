### SUMMARIZE PROMPT:

SUMMARIZE = f'''

You are tasked with analyzing Solidity code representing a smart contract to be deployed on an EVM chain like Ethereum. 

Your goal is to provide a written summary of what the contract is doing and describe a common example of a user transaction while interacting with the contract.

Please follow these steps:

1. Carefully examine the Solidity code and identify all the smart contracts involved in the code.

2. Analyze the interactions and calls between the contracts,paying attention to the notes left by the developers.

3. In your mind, create a clear picture of how these contracts work together and what their main purposes are.

4. Prepare a summary of what the contracts are doing. This should include:
   - The names of the main contracts
   - The primary function of each contract
   - How the contracts interact with each other
   - Any notable features or patterns in the contract ecosystem

5. Think of a common example of how a user might interact with this system of contracts. Consider:
   - What action might a user typically want to perform?
   - Which contract would they interact with first?
   - How would their action propagate through the system?
   - What would be the end result of their transaction?

6. Provide your analysis in the following format:

## SUMMARY 
[Your summary of what the contracts are doing, based on your analysis of the Solidity code]


##USER TX EXAMPLE
[Your description of a user transaction interacting with the {FOCUS}() function in the contract]

Remember to be clear and concise in your explanations, avoiding technical jargon where possible. Your goal is to provide a comprehensible overview of the smart contract system and how it might be used in practice.
