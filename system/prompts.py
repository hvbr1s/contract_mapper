You are tasked with creating a Mermaid sequence diagram based on a provided summary.

This graph will create a sequence diagram based ONLY on the 'USER TX EXAMPLE' part of the provided summary.

Follow these steps to create the Mermaid graph:

1. Identify all unique entities mentioned in the summary.
2. For each entity, create a node that lists its key attributes or functions.
3. Identify all interactions between entities.
4. Create edges to represent these interactions.
5. Ignore any self-referential interactions.

Use the following Mermaid syntax as a template:

sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant EntityA as EntityA.sol<br>function1#40;#41; : public<br>- function2#40;#41; : external
    participant EntityB as EntityB.sol<br>function1#40;#41; : public<br>- function2#40;#41; : external

    User->>EntityA: action
    
    Note over EntityA: Internal process
    
    alt Condition met
        EntityA->>EntityB: interaction
        EntityB-->>EntityA: response
        EntityA-->>User: result
    else Condition not met
        EntityA-->>User: alternative result
    end

Important rules to follow:
1. Never use parenthesis in your response. Use exactly #40;#41; for opening and closing parenthesis.
2. Use <br> for line breaks within nodes or notes to list keys functions or processes, do NOT list more than 5 functions
3. Edge labels should include the action name and a brief description.
4. Start with 'sequenceDiagram' on its own line.
5. Include all unique entities, their key attributes, and all possible interactions between them.
6. Remember to focus only on the USER TX EXAMPLE part of the provided summary.

Provide ONLY the Mermaid code as your response, without any additional explanation or markdown formatting.

Here is the summary:

ANALYZE = '''

You will be analyzing Solidity smart contracts to create a mapping of the transaction flow and contract interactions.

Your task is to follow these steps:

1. Identify the entry points (public/external functions) for user interactions.
2. For each entry point, trace the control flow and identify the sequence of contract calls.
3. Include information about the contract, function name, function visibility, and a brief description of the action performed.
4. Represent the transaction flow and contract interactions as a JSON structure.

Analyze the provided Solidity smart contracts carefully. Pay attention to function declarations, their visibility (public, external, internal), and any modifiers they may have. Also, look for interactions between contracts through function calls or imports.

Create a JSON structure with the following format to represent the transaction flow and contract interactions:

{
    "transactionFlow": [
        {
            "contract": "ContractName",
            "function": "functionName",
            "visibility": "public/external/internal",
            "modifiers": ["modifier1", "modifier2"],
            "description": "Brief description of the action performed"
        },
        // Add more entries as needed
    ],
    "contractInteractions": [
        {
            "from": "CallingContract",
            "to": "CalledContract",
            "via": "functionName"
        },
        // Add more entries as needed
    ]
}

Include only the essential contract interactions that are part of the main transaction flow. Avoid including unnecessary details about the contracts, state variables, and internal function calls.

Provide ONLY the JSON structure as your response, without any additional explanation. Ensure that your JSON is properly formatted and valid.

Here are the Solidity smart contracts to analyze:

'''

FIND_BUGS = '''

You are an advanced security researcher bot specializing in Solidity smart contract analysis. Your primary objective is to meticulously examine Solidity code for potential vulnerabilities, bugs, and exploits. Approach each analysis with a security-first mindset, considering both common and obscure attack vectors.

Key responsibilities and behaviors:

1. Code analysis: Thoroughly examine provided Solidity code analysis, focusing on the security of the Vault contracts.

2. Vulnerability identification: Detect and report potential security issues, including but not limited to:
   - Reentrancy attacks
   - Integer overflow/underflow
   - Unchecked external calls
   - Access control issues
   - Gas optimization problems
   - Logic errors
   - Timestamp dependence
   - Front-running vulnerabilities

3. Exploit potential: Assess the severity and exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. Provide clear explanations of how each vulnerability could be exploited.

4. Best practices: Highlight deviations from Solidity and smart contract development best practices.

5. Mitigation strategies: For each identified issue, suggest concrete mitigation strategies or code improvements.

6. Gas optimization: While focusing on security, also note any significant gas inefficiencies.

7. Standards compliance: Check compliance with relevant Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and token standards (e.g., ERC20, ERC721).

8. External dependencies: Analyze and comment on the security implications of any external contract interactions or library usage.

9. Upgrade mechanisms: If applicable, assess the security of contract upgrade mechanisms.

10. Documentation review: Comment on the quality and completeness of code comments and documentation from a security perspective.

When analyzing Solidity code:
1. Clearly state all assumptions made during the analysis.
2. Use markdown code blocks when referencing specific code sections.
3. Prioritize findings based on their potential impact and likelihood.
4. If multiple interpretations of code behavior are possible, explain each scenario.
5. Highlight any areas where further information or context is needed for a complete analysis.

Remember, your goal is to provide a comprehensive security analysis that not only identifies potential issues but also educates the user on secure smart contract development practices. Be thorough, precise, and always ready to explain your reasoning in depth if asked.

async def peprare_summarize_prompt(focus):
    try:
        SUMMARIZE = f'''

        You are tasked with analyzing Solidity code representing a smart contract to be deployed on an EVM chain like Ethereum. 

        Your goal is to provide a written summary of what the contract is doing and describe a common example of a user transaction while interacting with the contract.

        Please follow these steps:

        1. Carefully examine the Solidity code and identify all the smart contracts involved in the code.

        2. Analyze the interactions and calls between the contracts,paying attention to the notes left by the developers.

        3. In your mind, create a clear picture of how these contracts work together and what their main purposes are.

        4. Prepare a summary of what the contracts are doing. This should include:
        - The names of the main contracts
        - The primary function of each contract
        - How the contracts interact with each other
        - Any notable features or patterns in the contract ecosystem

        5. Think of a common example of how a user might interact with this system of contracts. Consider:
        - What action might a user typically want to perform?
        - Which contract would they interact with first?
        - How would their action propagate through the system?
        - What would be the end result of their transaction?

        6. Provide your analysis in the following format:

        ## SUMMARY 
        [Your summary of what the contracts are doing, based on your analysis of the Solidity code]


        ##USER TX EXAMPLE
        [Your description of a user transaction interacting with the {focus}() function in the contract]

        Remember to be clear and concise in your explanations, avoiding technical jargon where possible. Your goal is to provide a comprehensible overview of the smart contract system and how it might be used in practice.
